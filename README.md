# Lab 1 for the subject "User Interface Development" :triangular_ruler:

:mortar_board: We did this lab in the second year of university in the fourth semester.

It was a teamwork, so it was a good opportunity to gain experience in communication and interaction with team members (our team consisted of 4 people).

________________________________________________________________________________________________

What did we use :question:

:computer: __HTML__ and __CSS__

What have we done :question:

It was a pixel perfect layout.
We created a web page based on the layout using HTML and CSS, the Font Awesome icon library.

### :paperclip: [This is our web page.](https://nika-doroshkevich.github.io/RPI_Lab_1/)

Requirements for the web page:
- Clicking on the logo should return the user to the main page.
- Navigation should be implemented using links and underlined or highlighted on hover.
- All buttons on the page must respond to the hover.
- Icons are made using the font-awesome library, the use of simple images is prohibited (except in cases when the icon is not in the library). They should also be wrapped in links.
- Navigation in footer should be implemented using links and underlined or highlighted on hover.
